**Copywriter & Brand Strategist**  
Turning brands into voices people trust.  
I craft bold, clear, conversion-driven copy for fashion, e-commerce & campaigns—delivering impact, loyalty & results beyond discounts.

## 🔥 What I Do  
- **E-commerce & Fashion Copy** – Hero banners, product descriptions, category pages.  
- **Campaign Messaging** – Seasonal promos turned into cultural moments.  
- **Brand Voice Development** – Tone that’s unique, memorable, and consistent.  
- **Email & Ad Copy** – Short, sharp, scroll-stopping lines that sell.
